### Synopsis
Two star-crossed lovers shine brightly, only to have their love extinguished as soon as it ignites. This is a romance of falling in love and coming together to change the course of a city's fateâ€”only to be thwarted by blind loyalty, pride, and those who believe they know what is best.
